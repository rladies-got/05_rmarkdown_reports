Files and presentation for the meetup Data reporting with RMarkdown: from novice to master

This repository stores .Rmd script, additional file, and presentation for the meetup on how to use RMarkdown for reports.

## Description of the event
This meetup will cover basic features of RMarkdown and a few tricks that may help to create professional analytical reports using data. RMarkdown is a markup language, which enables users to embed R code in the document, edit text and document styles, and render visual information. Documents created using RMarkdown can be exported in a variety of formats, including .docx and .pdf.

Knowledge of RMarkdown allows R users integrate text and data analysis results in one place easier, including data checks, tables, and visualization. Additional benefit of RMarkdown is its ability to present data and analysis in interactive manner but this feature is out of the focus of this meeting.
